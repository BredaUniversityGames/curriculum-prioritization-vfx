I also feel like lots of students are trying to only push perfectly polished things to artstation ( myself included when i studied ). Studies are also always just nice to see if presented right, a speedsculpt for example as character artist, with just polypainted that is rendered right also does the job to showcase your skills. ( less documentation would be nice, and more time on getting those soft/hard skills ) all in all I think buas is doing great, maybe post more on linkedin, showcase work from students or tell students to be more active on linkedin after each project, and that they shouldnt be afraid to contact people. ive had some students approach me and ask for feedback and i think most of my coworkers would love to give feedback to people. encourage them to be brave and just go for it!"
