I would give the possibility for people to keep doing this, but also for people to explore more within year 2. more lectures, or groups you could join to practice. I also feel like lots of students are trying to only push perfectly polished things to artstation ( myself included when i studied ). Studies are also always just nice to see if presented right, a speedsculpt for example as character artist, with just polypainted that is rendered right also does the job to showcase your skills. ( less documentation would be nice, and more time on getting those soft/hard skills ) all in all I think buas is doing great, maybe post more on linkedin, showcase work from students or tell students to be more active on linkedin after each project, and that they shouldnt be afraid to contact people. ive had some students approach me and ask for feedback and i think most of my coworkers would love to give feedback to people. encourage them to be brave and just go for it!"

There is no need to encourage students to do one or the other, as long as they make proper use of reference and are learning to understand key concepts. Character art is often overcomplicated, teach students one way through the pipeline first, but make it clear it isn't the only way. Then introduce more complex ways of doing things as appropriate. Explain why UV padding and directional UVs are important, teach retopology in a simple way (articulation loops first, then build on that knowledge) and let students paint normal maps.

Everyone wants to be a character artist, so you're competing with the absolute best. Unless you're a superstar with lots of experience, getting hired as a character artist for a major studio is unlikely. Assembling a good portfolio should be mindful of this. Maybe game educations should include lessons in how to assemble a good portfolio."
